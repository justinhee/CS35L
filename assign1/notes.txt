Lab 1.5 Questions

1. Using which mv sh, it is clear that they are located respectively in /usr/local/cs/bin/mv and /usr/bin/sh.

2. I printed all of the two-character executable commands in /usr/bin ending in r using find /usr/bin -executable -name ?r -print. This outputted the commands /usr/bin/ar, /usr/bin/pr, and /usr/bin/tr. Then I looked up what they do using man /usr/bin/ar, man /usr/bin/pr, and man /usr/bin/tr.
   /usr/bin/ar: creates, modifies, and extracts from archives (an archive being a single file holding a collection of other files 

3. using ls -l on /usr/bin/emacs, we see that it is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/emacs. Going further, we can do ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs and see that it is a symlink itself, this time going to /usr/bin/emacs-26.1. So, when you execute the command /usr/bin/emacs, it is actually executing /usr/bin/emacs-26.1.

4. /usr/bin/gcc -v tells us that the version is 8.3.1. gcc -v tells us that the version is 10.2.0. These are different programs because we have prepended /usr/local/cs/bin to our path, so when gcc is called it calls /usr/local/cs/bin/gcc instead of /usr/bin/gcc. This is evident when we run which gcc, which returns /usr/local/cs/bin/gcc.

5.The symbolic mode u+sx,o-w combines the two commands u+sx and o-w. u+sx makes the file executable, and executes it under the owner's id every time. o-w takes away write permissions from the "other" group, so they can't modify the contents of the file. 

6. I used the command find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 to output all the directories under /usr/local/cs that have been modified in the last 4 weeks. Since there were so many, I then used the command find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc -l to count the lines and return 370, meaning there are 370 directories in /usr/local/cs that have been modified in the last 4 weeks. The first five entries were:
   /usr/local/cs
   /usr/local/cs/.del
   /usr/local/cs/.del/ocaml-4.11.1
   /usr/local/cs/bin
   /usr/local/cs/emacs-27.2

7. First, I used which find to find out where find is located, which is /usr/bin/find. Then I used the command find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l to see that there are 248 symlinks in that directory. Using man wc, it is evident that wc is able to print newline, word, and byte counts for each file. The -l modifier prints the newline counts, and since find prints each result on a newline, it's easy to count the results with wc -l.

8. To not ignore entries starting with ., use the option -a. To sort by time, newest first, use the option -t. To see the listed date, use the option -l to show the long form. I used the command ls /usr/lib64 -a -t -l, and the oldest file was listed last. It was libcrypt.so.1.1.0, modified August 12 2018.

9. According to man locale, locale displays information about the current locale, or all locales, on standard output. It says that /usr/share/i18n/locales is the usual default path for locale definition files.

10. I used C-h a downcase to find that the following commands in Emacs contain downcase
    downcase-dwim	  M-x ... RET
    downcase-region	C-x C-l
    downcase-word	M-l


11. I used C-h b to open all the Emacs keybindings, and then used C-s on each of C-M-r through C-M-v. Then I selected their descriptions, and found the following:
    C-M-r  repeats incremental search backwards
    C-M-s  does an incremental search forward for a regular expression
    C-M-t  does a transpose on sexps (a sexp is a balanced expression), switching the positions of the previous and next balanced expression.
    C-M-u  moves backward out of one level of parentheses, or other parentheses-like expressions
    C-M-v  scrolls the next window upward

12. I used C-h k C-g to find out more about C-g. C-g runs the command keyboard-quit. This causes a quit from the execution of the Lisp code, and plays a beeping sound.

13. I used C-h b and then C-s yank to find that the yank command is called using C-y. Then I did C-h k C-y. The yank function reinserts the last bit of killed text. It's like the "paste" part of "cut and paste"

14. First, I looked up dired using C-h f dired, and found that it does much of the same thing as ls, printing the files in a directory. Then I did both ls -l /usr/bin and C-x d /usr/bin to compare the outputs. When looking through the two outputs, it seemed like the only visible differences were that C-x d /usr/bin included the . and .. directories.



Homework:

What's does each of the commands do and how do they change?
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
   replaces everything that wasn't a letter with a newline
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
   the -s command makes it so repeated characters are listed only once, effectively getting rid of the big patches of newlines
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
   this now lists them in sorted order
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
   the -u command makes it so words are not repeated
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - sorted.words
   compares the sorted word output to sorted.words in 3 columns. The first is lines unique to the sorted word output, the 2nd is lines unique to the "dictionary", and the 3rd is lines that appear in both files
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - sorted.words
   the -23 flag suppresses the 2nd and 3rd columns, so the only output is lines unique to the sorted word output
